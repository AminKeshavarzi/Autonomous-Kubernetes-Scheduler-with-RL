# Autonomous-Kubernetes-Scheduler-with-RL
To develop and implement a scheduler for Kubernetes (k8s), you need a real cluster environment or a simulator. You have four options:

- Use a [real Kubernetes/Minikube environment](repos/real_cluster/README.md)
- Use a [scheduler simulator](repos/scheduler_simulator/README.md)
- Use a [kind/ KWOK](repos/kind_cluster/README.md)
- Simulate the environment yourself using [my-simulator](repos/my-simulator/README.md)
